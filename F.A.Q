What can this play?

Retroarch is the main emu used. So most normal retroarch cores.

N64, psp, dreamcast, and nds use standalone emulators/apps.

N64 performance is very smooth . Most games function better than retropie. This is due to emus used that were designed for android low end phones.

Psp, dremcast and NDS performance is about the same as retropie.

Sega Saturn performance is still quite slow and not worth the time really. Same currently with gamecube and wii.

This may change will update if it does .

Hows this different from Konstakangs build ?

WickedOS has everything installed for ya. Retroarch, other emus, a retro frontend etc. Some of these apps are special versions or modified.

In the future we will be attempting to compile android ourselves. This, if successful, will be the biggest difference.

Open "Aurora Store". It is a normal app store and will install apps for you.

Search for and install your desired app.

Sometimes these apps will not show in frontend, to solve this.

Click on settings in Android system, then unhide files. If you see desired app listed unhide it will show in frontend.
