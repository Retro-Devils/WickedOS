## WickedOS Version: 1.1 

- Updated October 22, 2021 

# General Info 

- WickedOS is a android based, retro gaming os. Built for the Raspberry Pi 4.

- WickedOS is built on Konstakangs Lineage 17.1.
  
## First Boot Setup 

1.You need a keyboard and mouse plugged in.

2.Press and hold F5 press reboot the recovery .

3.After reboot click "Install"

4.Find /sdcard/Tools/TWRP/resizePI4.zip.

5.This is resizing your the image to your SD card size . 

6.Swipe to install wait then reboot to system , 

## F.A.Q 

## What can this play?

- Retroarch is the main emu used. So most normal retroarch cores.

- N64, psp, dreamcast, and nds use standalone emulators/apps.  

- N64 performance is very smooth . Most games function better than retropie. This is due to emus used that were designed for android low end phones.

- Psp, dremcast and NDS performance is about the same as retropie. 

- Sega Saturn performance is still quite slow and not worth the time really. Same currently with gamecube and wii.

- This may change will update if it does .

## Hows this different from Konstakangs build ?

- WickedOS has everything installed for ya. Retroarch, other emus, a retro frontend etc. Some of these apps are special versions or modified. 

- In the future we will be attempting to compile android ourselves. This, if successful, will be the biggest difference.  

## How to add android games ? 

From dig frontend 

- Open Android 

- Open "Aurora Store". It is a normal app store and will install apps for you. 

- Search for and install your desired app. 

Sometimes these apps will not show in frontend, to solve this.

- Click on settings in Android system, then unhide files. If you see desired app listed unhide it will show in frontend. 

- If above do not work the app will more than likely not show in frontend 

## Where do i download this at? 

- Uploaded to Arcade Punks 10/20/21. 

## How to add Google Play store ? 

- Download open_gapps-arm-10.0-pico-xxxxxxxx.zip and save it to your deviceâ€™s internal storage or use an external USB driveBoot to TWRP recovery.

- Install open_gapps-arm-10.0-pico-xxxxxxxx.zip from your selected storage

- Wipe -> Factory reset!

- Boot out of recovery.

- See Konstakangs site for more about play store install. Link in sources at bottom of this guthub.

## Controller Configuration/Help.

On boot WickedOS is setup for a Xbox One style controller. 

To adjust controls

- Open Retroarch set controls 

- Repeat for standalone emus. Each one is a little different.Examples N64, PSP, Dreamcast etc 

- Standalone emus will be in android section of frontend.

- If frontend feels/operates weird. Go to options/App/controller config. It will display a controller that you can change the mapping.

Controller Help 

- Press home one time will take you back to frontend . Twice will ask what app to launch. Select DIG. 

- My controller didn't work!!?!? Remeber this is android get a controller thats used with android.  

- Does bluetooth work . With right controller yes . 

- What controller do you recommend? Xbox One, PS4, and Gamesir(highest ranked) . 


## Notes and comments 

- Please see Konstakangs Website for more FAQ.

- Tested many times so far so good . 

- If you have problems please report to "Retro Devils Support" Facebook group. Konstakangs build is super solid, if thiers a issue its more than likely something we did .

- This is open source project so feel free to use and modify .

- Other android builds exist.

- You can easily DIY this to a extent. We built custom themes, used different apks etc. 

- With DIY aspect in mind we did not release a base. Just Arcade Punks version. Base will be released when/if we compile android ourselves. 

- Don't like the boot video? Use Boot animator in android section to change it , 


# Whats the future plans for WickedOS?

- More version and images built on os. 

- Focus on getting more  "popular " systems before all systems .

- A "Frontend Switcher ". Partly implemented now . Press home twice select frontend to launch. Currently list all apps to pick from as home app.
