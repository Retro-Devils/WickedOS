## Notes and comments 

- Please see Konstakangs Website for more FAQ.

- Tested many times so far so good . 

- If you have problems please report to "Retro Devils Support" Facebook group. Konstakangs build is super solid, if thiers a issue its more than likely something we did .

- This is open source project so feel free to use and modify .

- Other android builds exist.

- You can easily DIY this to a extent. We built custom themes, used different apks etc. 

- With DIY aspect in mind we did not release a base. Just Arcade Punks version. Base will be released when/if we compile android ourselves. 

- Don't like the boot video? Use Boot animator in android section to change it , 


# Whats the future plans for WickedOS?

- More version and images built on os. 

- Focus on getting more  "popular " systems before all systems .
